\item[Problem 11.1:]  
Consider the following problem {\sc Colorful-Walk} (which is an extension of Problem 8.2(b) from HW8):
\begin{quote}
{\em Input\/}: a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, a vertex $s\in V$,
and a color $c(e)\in \{1,\ldots,k\}$ for each edge $e\in E$, and a number $\ell$.\\[2pt]
{\em Output\/}: ``yes'' iff there exists a walk that starts at $s$ and encounters at least $\ell$
distinct colors.
\end{quote}

Consider the {\sc Set-Cover} problem:
\begin{quote}
{\em Input\/}: a set $X$ of $N$ elements, a collection of $M$ subsets ${\cal S} =\{S_1,\ldots,S_M\}$ where each $S_i\subseteq X$,
and a number $K$.\\[2pt]
{\em Output\/}: ``yes'' iff there exists a subcollection ${\cal T}\subseteq {\cal S}$  of $K$ subsets, such that
the union of the subsets in ${\cal T}$ includes all elements of $X$.
\end{quote}

Describe a polynomial-time reduction from {\sc Set-Cover} to {\sc Colorful-Walk}.  Follow these steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Given an input to {\sc Set-Cover} (i.e., $X$, ${\cal S}$, and $K$),
describe a construction of an input to {\sc Colorful-Walk} (i.e., $G$, $s$, $c(\cdot)$, and $\ell$).
Check that your construction takes polynomial time.
\item Prove that the input to {\sc Set-Cover} has a ``yes'' answer \emph{if and only if} your input to {\sc Colorful-Walk} has a ``yes'' answer.
\end{itemize}
Since {\sc Set-Cover} is a well-known NP-hard problem, it would then follow that {\sc Colorful-Walk} is NP-hard.  

(Hint: for your construction of the directed graph $G$, try something like the picture below,  
with appropriate colors assigned to edges.  Remember that in the actual description of your construction, 
you are given $X$, ${\cal S}$, and $K$; you are \emph{not} given ${\cal T}$, which may or may not exist, since the goal is to determine whether the answer is ``yes'' or ``no''.)

\item[Problem 11.2:]
By now, everyone has heard of Wordle, the online word-guessing game.
Here, you will consider a tougher variant of the game, where
the word length $n$ is a variable, all strings of length $n$ from a fixed
alphabet are legal words (no dictionary needed!), and after each guess, you are only told
whether there is a green (matching) position, but not the number of green (nor yellow)
positions, nor where they are exactly.  You will show that in this version of the game,
just deciding whether there exists a solution after a series of guesses is already hard (so forget about
the question of how to generate a good next guess!).  


\newcommand{\match}{\textrm{match}}
\newcommand{\true}{\textrm{true}}
\newcommand{\false}{\textrm{false}}
If you didn't follow the above paragraph, don't worry---here is the precise definition of
our problem:
For two strings $y$ and $z$ of length $n$, first define $\match(y,z)$ to be true
if there exists a position~$k$ such that the $k$-th symbol of $y$
is equal to the $k$-th symbol of $z$, and false otherwise.
The statement of the {\sc Tough-Wordle} problem is as follows:
\begin{quote}
{\em Input\/}: a finite alphabet~$\Sigma$, a list of $m$ strings $y_1,\ldots,y_m\in\Sigma^n$,
and $m$ Boolean values $b_1,\ldots,b_m\in\{\true,\false\}$.\\[2pt]
{\em Output\/}: ``yes'' iff there exists a string~$z\in\Sigma^n$
such that $\match(y_i,z)=b_i$ for each $i=1,\ldots,m$.
\end{quote}

(Example: on the input with $\Sigma=\{A,B,C\}$,
$y_1=AAAA$, $b_1=\true$, $y_2=BBCC$, 
$b_2=\true$, $y_3=BCAB$, $b_3=\false$, the answer is ``yes'', e.g., by 
choosing $z=ABCC$.)

Describe a polynomial-time reduction from {\sc 3SAT} to {\sc Tough-Wordle}.  Follow these steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Given an input to {\sc 3SAT} (i.e., a Boolean formula $F$ in 3CNF form),
describe a construction of an input to {\sc Tough-Wordle} (i.e., an alphabet $\Sigma$, and 
a list of strings and Boolean values).
Check that your construction takes polynomial time.
\item Prove that $F$ is
satisfiable \emph{if and only if} your input to {\sc Tough-Wordle} has a ``yes''
answer.
\end{itemize}
Since {\sc 3SAT} is NP-hard, it would then follow that {\sc Tough-Wordle} is NP-hard. 

(Hint: in your construction, an alphabet of size~3 (0, 1,
and an extra symbol) would be sufficient.  Suppose $F$ has $n$ variables and 
$m$ clauses.  Intuitively, the string $z$ (if exists) should correspond to a satisfying assignment of $F$ (if exists).  For each clause $C_i$, construct a string $y_i$ of length $n$ (and a corresponding Boolean value $b_i$) to somehow make sure that $z$
contains at least one true literal of $C_i$.  Also, construct an extra string to somehow make sure that $z$ uses only 0s and 1s and not the extra symbol\ldots\ \ Remember that in the actual description of your construction, 
all you are given is $F$; you are \emph{not} given a satisfying assignment, which may or may not exist, since the goal is to determine whether the answer is ``yes'' or ``no''.)
