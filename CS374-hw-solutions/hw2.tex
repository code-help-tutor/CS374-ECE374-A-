\item[Problem 2.1:]
For each of the
following languages,
give
a regular expression that describes that language, and briefly
argue why your expression is correct.
Below, $\#_0(x)$ denotes the number of 0's in $x$, and $\#_1(x)$ denotes the number of 1's in $x$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] All strings in $\{0,1\}^*$ of length at least 5 such that 
the symbols at positions divisible by 5 are all 0's.
For example: 
the string $1001{\bf 0}1111{\bf 0}0101{\bf 0}11$ is in the language because the bold symbols are all 0's.
\item[(b)] All strings $x\in\{0,1\}^*$ such that $x$ does not begin with $101$ and 
$\#_0(x)$ is divisible by 3.
\item[(c)] All strings in $\{0,1\}^*$ that do not contain $0111$ as a substring.
\item[(d)] All strings in $\{0,1,2\}^*$ that have at least four 0's and exactly two 1's.
\end{enumerate}


\bigskip
\item[Problem 2.2:]
Describe a DFA that accepts each of the following languages.
Describe briefly what each state in your DFA \emph{means}.
For (a)--(c), you should draw the complete DFA.
For (d), do not attempt to draw your DFA, since the number of states could be huge; instead,
give a mathematically precise description of the states $Q$, 
the start state $s$, the accepting states $A$, and the transition function $\delta$.



\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] (20 pts) All strings in $\{0,1\}^*$ of length at least 5 such that 
the symbols at positions divisible by 5 are all 0's.
\item[(b)] (20 pts) All strings $x\in\{0,1\}^*$ such that $x$ does not begin with $101$ and 
$\#_0(x)$ is divisible by 3.
\item[(c)] (20 pts) All strings in $\{0,1\}^*$ that do not contain $011001$ as a substring.
\item[(d)] (40 pts) All strings $x\in\{0,1\}^*$ such that $x$ contains $0^9$ as a substring, or
$|x|$ is divisible by 8, or $\#_0(x)-\#_1(x)$ is divisible by 7.
