\item[Problem 10.1:]  
Consider the following geometric matching problem: Given a set
$A$ of $n$ points and a set $B$ of $n$ points in 2D, find a set of $n$ pairs
$S=\{(a_1,b_1),\ldots, (a_n,b_n)\}$, with $\{a_1,\ldots, a_n\}=A$ and
$\{b_1,\ldots, b_n\}=B$, minimizing $f(S)=\sum_{i=1}^n d(a_i,b_i)$.
Here, $d(a_i,b_i)$ denotes the Euclidean distance between $a_i$
and $b_i$ (which you may assume can be computed in $O(1)$ time).

Assume that all points in $A$ have $y$-coordinate equal to 0
and all points in $B$ have $y$-coordinate equal to 1.
(Thus, all points lie on two horizontal lines.)  The points are not sorted.
See the example below, which shows a solution that is definitely not optimal.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] (20 pts)\ \ Consider the following greedy strategy:
pick a pair $(a,b)\in A\times B$ minimizing $d(a,b)$;
then remove $a$ from $A$ and $b$ from $B$, and repeat. 
Give a counterexample showing that this algorithm does not always give
an optimal solution.

\smallskip
\item[(b)] (40 pts)\ \ Let $a$ be the point in $A$ with the smallest $x$-coordinate.
Let $b$ be the point in $B$ with the smallest $x$-coordinate.
Consider a solution $S$ in which $a$ is paired with some point $b'$ with $b'\neq b$, and $b$
is paired with some point $a'$ with $a'\neq a$.
Prove that the solution $S$ can be modified to obtain a new solution $S'$ with $f(S')<f(S)$.

(Hint: the triangle inequality might be useful.)

\smallskip
\item[(c)] (40 pts)\ \ Now give a correct greedy algorithm to solve the problem.  (The correctness
should follow from (b).)  Analyze the running time.
\end{enumerate}

\item[Problem 10.2:] 
We are given an unweighted undirected connected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges (with $m\ge n-1$),
We are also given two vertices $s,t\in V$ and an ordering of the edges $e_1,\ldots,e_m\in E$.  Suppose the edges $e_1,\ldots,e_m$ are deleted one by one in that order.
We want to determine the first time when $s$ and $t$ become disconnected.
In other words, we want to find the smallest index $j$ such that $s$ and $t$ are not connected in the graph $G_j=(V,E-\{e_1,\ldots,e_j\})$.

A naive approach to solve this problem is to run BFS/DFS on $G_j$ for each $j=1,\ldots,m$, but this
would require $O(mn)$ time.
You will investigate a more efficient algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] (80 pts)\ \ Define a weighted graph $G'$ with the same vertices and edges as $G$, where
edge $e_i$ is given weight $-i$.  Let $T$ be the minimum spanning tree of $G'$.
Let $\pi$ be the path from $s$ to $t$ in $T$.
Let $j^*$ be the smallest index such that $e_{j^*}$ is in $\pi$.
Prove that the answer to the above problem is exactly $j^*$.

\item[(b)] (20 pts)\ \ Following the approach in (a), analyze the running time needed to compute $j^*$.
\end{enumerate}

\item[Problem 10.3:] 
Consider the following search problem:
\begin{quote}
{\sc Max-Disjoint-Triples}:\\[2pt]
\emph{Input:} a set $S$ of $n$ positive integers and an integer $L$.\\[2pt]
\emph{Output:} pairwise disjoint triples $\{a_1,b_1,c_1\},\ldots,\{a_{k^*},b_{k^*},c_{k^*}\}\subseteq S$,
maximizing the number of triples $k^*$, such that $a_i+b_i+c_i\le L$ for each $i$.
\end{quote}
For example, if $S=\{3,10,29,30,35,55,70,83,90\}$ and $L=100$, an optimal solution is 
$\{3,10,83\},\{29,30,35\}$, with two triples (there is no solution with three triples).

Consider the following decision problem:
\begin{quote}
{\sc Disjoint-Triples-Decision}:\\[2pt]
\emph{Input:} a set $S$ of $n$ positive integers, an integer $L$, and
an integer $k$.\\[2pt]
\emph{Output:} True iff there exist $k$ pairwise disjoint triples $\{a_1,b_1,c_1\},\ldots, \{a_k,b_k,c_k\} \subseteq S$, such that $a_i+b_i+c_i\le L$ for each $i$.
\end{quote}

Prove that {\sc Max-Disjoint-Triples} has a polynomial-time algorithm iff {\sc Disjoint-Triples-Decision}
has a polynomial-time algorithm.  

(Note: One direction should be easy.  For the other direction, see lab 12b for examples of this type of question. In {\sc Max-Disjoint-Triples},
the output is not the optimal value $k^*$ but an optimal set of triples, although it may be helpful to give a subroutine to compute the optimal value $k^*$ as a first step, as in the lab examples.)
